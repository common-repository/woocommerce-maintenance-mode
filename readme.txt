Store messages or redirects on all WooCommerce pages for non admins. Other pages/posts unaffected. Ideal for store maintenance or store wide notices.

== Description ==

Easily choose between redirecting users or displaying notifications with the option to disable e-commerce functionality whilst still allowing product visibility. You can set your notifications to occur site wide or only on WooCommerce pages, thus not affecting any other part of your website.

Logged in admins will not be redirected or see the notifications set in the backend, so you can continue working, testing and managing your store seemllessly without your users ever being aware you are working on it and without it interfearing with your work flow.

**For Premium Users:**

You can set an end date that will automatically disable redirects or notications to resume your store to its normal view, just in case you forget. You can also enjoy the flexibility of being able to adjust the frequency at which to display your store notifications or redirects to your users.

You will also be able to create your custom messages with a WYSIWYG editor(just like on a page or post), making use of lightbox popup modals and be able to use any shortcodes including some bundled with the premium version for your convenience.


Requires WordPress 3.0 + and WooCommerce 2.0 +.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The plugin isn't working?! =

The premise of maintenance mode is to have your visitors see one thing and someone logged in as an admin to see the real state of the website so make sure you are logged out or alternatively, ig you are logged in you can use the built in preview button or tab.

If the activation is not toggled on, you will see your settings applied to the site in preview mode but this will not be live so none of your website visitors or you will see this.
